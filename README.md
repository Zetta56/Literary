# Literary
A website that allows users to create and share pieces of literature with others.

## Motivation
This is my first personal project that includes concepts and technologies such as RESTful routing, the MEN stack, and basic authentication.

## Requirements
This site relies on the following:

1. Node.js
2. npm

Other important techonologies include:

1. Express
2. Mongoose
3. Passport

## Usage
You should create a `.env` file and set `process.env.DatabaseUrl` to your database. Alternatively, you can follow [these instructions](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/) to install **mongoDB**.

To manually run the site, you can type:

	node app.js
