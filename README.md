# Literary
A web app that allows users to create and share pieces of literature with others.

## Motivation
This is my first personal project that includes concepts and technologies such as RESTful routing, the MEN stack, and basic authentication.

## Requirements
This app relies on the following:

1. Node.js
2. npm

## Usage
1. Create a `.env` file and set `process.env.DatabaseUrl` to your database. If you want to set up a local database, you can follow [these instructions](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/) to install **mongoDB**.

2. Install all necessary dependencies using:

       npm install

3. To manually start the app, run:

       node app.js
